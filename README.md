# Hilton React-Native / GraphQL Reservation Demo

## Goal/Requirements

Create a React Native reservation app using ES6 and pure components. Create at least 2 screens:

1 for listing the existing reservations and 1 for adding a new reservation.

## Tech Stack

Please utilize the following technology stack for developing your application.

- React-Native

- Apollo-Client

- Jest/Enzyme

- Typescript or Flow

## Back End

We have provided a GraphQL back end for you: https://us1.prisma.sh/public-luckox-377/reservation-graphql-backend/dev

Use the following queries from the back end to complete the test.
query: reservations, reservation
mutation: createReservation

## Limitations

Please DO NOT use the following items.

- create-react-native-app, or any other generator (use react-native init to start the project)

- redux (use another method for local state management)

- A non git service for hosting (github/gitlab/etc are ok)

## What We Are Looking For

The following list outlines areas we will be focusing on while evaluating your submission.

Code organization (even though this is two features, organize the files as if it were a larger enterprise application)

- Style organization

- Data/Graph Organization

- Component Organization

- Folder Structure

- Type checking

- A clean method for managing local state with GraphQL queries

- Unit test methodology/readability

- Code readability (i.e. ability for future developers to pick up where you left off)

- A communicative README.md explaining the architecture choices

## Submission

Please provide a git link to the source code.
